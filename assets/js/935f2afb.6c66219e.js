Traditionally, centralized exchanges, like Binance, provide and manage this liquidity. On 0xDefi, the liquidity is provided voluntarily by its users. In return, 0xDefi rewards those who provide temporary access to their tokens with a share of the 0.25% fee charged to traders of the respective token pair, proportional to the amount of liquidity they added to the pool. This option could be a great opportunity to earn extra yields on tokens that are just sitting in your wallet.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"Tutorials/How to Get Started on 0xDefi/How to Swap":{"id":"Tutorials/How to Get Started on 0xDefi/How to Swap","title":"How to Swap","description":"0xSwap makes cryptocurrency trading simple.
