### What is impermanent loss (IL)?

CoinMarketCap defines impermanent loss as “the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair.” To put this into perspective, if you are holding an LP token, and one of the assets depreciates in value in the short term, but gradually returns to the original price, then you would have lost value "impermanently." Alternatively, if the same asset appreciated in value before reverting to the mean, you would have had "impermanent gains." These metrics can help liquidity providers balance their portfolios for optimal ratios. For instance, if you think a token will appreciate, and then revert to the mean, you might provide liquidity before it appreciates, just to accumulate the fees for that duration.
